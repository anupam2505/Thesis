Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together.The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n).By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p{\textgreater}{\textgreater}n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

We demonstrate that our simple method of enhancing face recognition with social network context substantially increases recognition performance beyond that of a baseline face recognition system.},

A second level of larger and more in- variant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a su- pervised classifier on these features yields 0.64{\%} error on MNIST, and 54{\%} average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the result- ing architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely super- vised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples.},

The goals of the Cyber ontology effort are first described, followed by a discussion of the ontology development methodology used. The main body of the paper then follows, which is a description of the potential ontologies and standards that could be utilized to extend the Cyber ontology from its initially constrained malware focus. These resources include, in particular, Cyber and malware standards, schemas, and terminologies that directly contributed to the initial malware ontology effort. Other resources are upper (sometimes called 'foundational') ontologies. Core concepts that any Cyber ontology will extend have already been identified and rigorously defined in these foundational ontologies. However, for lack of space, this section is profoundly reduced. In addition, utility ontologies that are focused on time, geospatial, person, events, and network operations are briefly described. These utility ontologies can be viewed as specialized super-domain or even mid-level ontologies, since they span many, if not most, ontologies -- including any Cyber ontology. An overall view of the ontological architecture used by the trade study is also given. The report on the trade study concludes with some proposed next steps in the iterative evolution of the Cyber},

abstract = {To adapt to the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats, secu-rity professionals are actively exchanging Indicators of Compro-mise (IOC) (e.g., malware signatures, botnet IPs) through public sources (e.g. blogs, forums, tweets, etc.). Such information, of-ten presented in articles, posts, white papers etc., can be converted into a machine-readable OpenIOC format for automatic analysis and quick deployment to various security mechanisms like an in-trusion detection system. With hundreds of thousands of sources in the wild, the IOC data are produced at a high volume and veloc-ity today, which becomes increasingly hard to manage by humans. Efforts to automatically gather such information from unstructured text, however, is impeded by the limitations of today's Natural Lan-guage Processing (NLP) techniques, which cannot meet the high standard (in terms of accuracy and coverage) expected from the IOCs that could serve as direct input to a defense system. In this paper, we present iACE, an innovation solution for fully automated IOC extraction. Our approach is based on the obser-vation that the IOCs in technical articles are often described in a predictable way: being connected to a set of context terms (e.g., " download ") through stable grammatical relations. Leveraging this observation, iACE is designed to automatically locate a putative IOC token (e.g., a zip file) and its context (e.g., " malware " , " down-load ") within the sentences in a technical article, and further an-alyze their relations through a novel application of graph mining techniques. Once the grammatical connection between the tokens is found to be in line with the way that the IOC is commonly pre-sented, these tokens are extracted to generate an OpenIOC item that describes not only the indicator (e.g., a malicious zip file) but also its context (e.g., download from an external source). Running on 71,000 articles collected from 45 leading technical blogs, this new approach demonstrates a remarkable performance: it gener-ated 900K OpenIOC items with a precision of 95{\%} and a coverage over 90{\%}, which is way beyond what the state-of-the-art NLP tech-nique and industry IOC tool can achieve, at a speed of thousands of articles per hour. Further, by correlating the IOCs mined from the articles published over a 13-year span, our study sheds new light on 1 The two lead authors are ordered alphabetically.},

This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Computer systems have become a very important part of our society, most of the information we use in our everyday lives is in its digital form, and since information is power it only makes sense that someone, somewhere will try to steal it. Attackers are adapting and now have access to highly sophisticated tools and expertise to conduct highly targeted and very complex attack campaigns. Advanced Persistent Threat, or APT, is a term coined by the United States Air Force around 2006 as a way to talk about classified intrusions with uncleared personnel. It wrongly and quickly became the standard acronym to describe every sort of attack. This work tries to demystify the problem of APTs, why they are called as such, and what are the most common tactics, techniques and procedures. It also discusses previously proposed life-cycles, profile the most common adversaries and takes a look at why traditional defences will not stop them. A big problem encountered while developing this work was the lack of statistics regarding APT attacks. One of the big contributions here consists on the search for publicly available reports, its analysis, and presentation of relevant information gathered in a summarised fashion. From the most targeted applications to the most typical infection vector, insight is given on how and why the adversaries conduct these attacks. Only after a clear understanding of the problem is reached, prevention and detection schemes were discussed. Specifically, blueprints for a system to be used by AnubisNetworks are presented, capable of detecting these attacks at the e-mail level. It is based on sandboxing and people mapping, which is a way to better understand people, one of the weakest links in security. The work is concluded by trying to understand how the threat landscape will shape itself in upcoming years.},

abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

In this paper, we aim to shed light on common malware behaviors. To this end, we evaluate the Anubis analysis results for almost one million malware samples, study trends and evolution of malicious behaviors over a period of almost two years, and examine the influence of code polymorphism on malware statistics.},

abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},
