\chapter{CONCLUSION} \label{chap:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced --- CNN based iGen, a novel system for automatic extraction of IOCs from different sources of unstructured data. Our approach starts from collection of security data from diverse sources. Then, it cleans the data using advanced NLP techniques. CNN based IOC identification technique is found to be highly effective, immensely outperforming the top industry IOC analyzer tool in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. iGen generates ready-to-deploy rules from these IOCs that can be directly deployed on security infrastructure like NIDS etc.

iGen uses different sources for data to make fully automated cyber threat intelligence gathering more collaborative. iGen has collected around 1 million IOCs till now with a precision of 95\%, better than any state-of-art method.
