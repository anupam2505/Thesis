DEDICATION
\end{center}
To my loving family and friends for their patience and support. I want to give special
note of appreciation to my late mother Madhu Panwar for her sacrifice and hard work which she
put in to teach me the importance of hardwork and being good human. She always wanted to see
me succeed. She sacrificed a lot of her personal interest and ambitions to provide all the necessary
resources needed for my success. Mom, this is for you! My twin brother Anupam motivated me to
do research and taught me never give up attitude. My father Dr. HR Panwar always supported
my decision. My elder brother Anshuman worked as catalyst for my success. Finally, I am forever
indebted to my family for their understanding, endless patience and encouragement when it was
most required.
