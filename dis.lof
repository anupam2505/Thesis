\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2}{\ignorespaces Architecture of CNN based sentence classification model. We show two filter region sizes: 4 and 5, each of which has 2 filters. Filters or kernels accomplish convolutions and apply activation functions on the sentence matrix and generate (variable-length) feature maps; 1-max pooling is performed over each map, i.e., the largest number from each feature map is recorded. Thus a univariate feature vector is generated from all 4 maps, and these 4 features are concatenated to form a feature vector for the penultimate layer. The final softmax layer then receives this feature vector as input and uses it to classify the sentence; here we are performing binary classification and hence depict two possible output states.\relax }}{21}
